            <p>this is the first text box i am adding out of the four mwahahah. The boy with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick
his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it
now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his
forehead. All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He
was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of
red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by
another.
"Hi!" it said. "Wait a minute!"
The undergrowth at the side of the scar was shaken and a multitude of raindrops fell
pattering.
"Wait a minute," the voice said. "I got caught up."
The fair boy stopped and jerked his stockings with an automatic gesture that made the
jungle seem for a moment like the Home Counties.
The voice spoke again.
"I can't hardly move with all these creeper things."
The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on
a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and
scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around.
He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe
lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles.
"Where's the man with the megaphone?"
The fair boy shook his head.
"This is an island. At least I think it's an island. That's a reef out in the sea. Perhaps
there aren't any grownups anywhere."
The fat boy looked startled.
"There was that pilot. But he wasn't in the passenger cabin, he was up in front."
The fair boy was peering at the reef through screwed-up eyes.
"All them other kids," the fat boy went on. "Some of them must have got out. They must
have, mustn't they?"</p>
